<h1> Educational Qualifications </h1>

<p> Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering -AI,
    Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham
    CGPA:7.3/10 
    06/2020-05/2024</p>
<p> Higher Secondary Education, Narayana Junior College

<h1> Projects: </h1>

<h2> <strong> HUMAN FACE DETECTION USING PCA AND SVM</strong></h2>
<p>Using PCA and SVM, created a facial recognition model.
•Dimension reduction using PCA and support vector Machine for Face recognition on
The Database of Faces at a glance.
•The Principal Component Analysis technique was used to shrink the dimensionality of
the data we obtained (photos) with multiple pixel values .Taken Dataset from Kaggle
and applied models to identify the errors and divided the training and testing datasets.
    </p>

<h2> <strong> IMAGE DEHAZING USING DCP METHOD</strong></h2>
<p>•Haze removal/image dehazing is the basic requirement in image processing and
    computer vision-based applications.
    •Once the haze removal algorithm removes the haze, then it is feasible for the computer
    vision algorithms to analyze them.
    •Natural images and their perception play an important role in image visualization and
    understanding.
    •Bright images can improve the precision of computer vision applications such as
    surveillance, object detection, image classification , image/video retrieval.
    •Dark Channel Prior (DCP) is one of the significant dehazing methods based upon the
    observation of the key features of the haze-free images.
    
</p>

<h2> <strong> OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE AND NAVIGATION ROBOT USING ROS </strong></h2>
<p>  •Sensors such as laser scanners or depth cameras to detect obstacles
    •The ROS navigation stack must be configured and tuned properly to perform these
    tasks.
    •Created a small machine with raspberrypi which can stop whenever it sees an obstacle.

<h1> Courses  </h1>
<h2> <strong> Intermediate Machine Learning,Kaggle </strong></h2>
<p>Machine learning deals with lots of algorithms which allows software applications to
    become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed</p>

<h2> <strong> Cyber Security,1Stopai Techfest ,IIT BOMBAY</strong> </h2>
<p> Conducted by 1stop where aspirants get good grip on the tools like Wireshark and Kali
    Linux. Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from
    digital attacks </p>

<h2> <strong> Introduction to Deep learning in python,Datacamp </strong></h2>
<p>Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example. Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign, or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost. </p>
